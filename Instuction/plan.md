## Current Plan (2025-05-18)

# Plan for Step 3: Implement Advanced Document Editor Interface

## 1. Analysis & Preparation
- Analyze the UI reference image in detail to understand all required components
- Research best practices for creating a document editor interface in Next.js
- Create design mockups and wireframes for responsive layouts
- Plan the state management approach for the editor interface

## 2. Setup Editor Layout Structure
- Create a new page component (`src/app/editor/page.tsx`)
- Implement the basic layout grid with the following main sections:
  - Top toolbar (primary actions)
  - Left sidebar (document-specific tools)
  - Right sidebar (editing tools)
  - Main canvas area
  - Bottom zoom controls
- Ensure layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes
- Implement dark theme styling that matches the reference design

## 3. Create Toolbar Components
- Develop the `TopToolbar` component with:
  - Upload button
  - Edit button
  - Convert button
  - Save button
  - Menu toggle button
- Create the `LeftSidebar` component with document-specific tools:
  - PDF Tools button
  - Word Tools button
  - Image-Editing Tools button
  - Add button for new tools
  - OCR/Scan tools button
  - Selection tool button
- Implement the `RightSidebar` component with editing tools:
  - Draw tool
  - Highlight tool
  - Text tool
  - Crop tool
- Create a `BottomToolbar` component with:
  - Zoom percentage display
  - Zoom in/out controls
  - Full screen toggle

## 4. Implement Canvas Area
- Create a `Canvas` component that:
  - Displays a grid background
  - Shows the document contents
  - Handles document scaling/zooming
  - Supports editing operations
  - Has a responsive design
- Implement document positioning and scaling within the canvas
- Add grid overlay with proper spacing and alignment

## 5. Develop Functionality & Interaction
- Create navigation from the upload page to the editor page
- Implement state passing between pages to maintain document context
- Create interactive tool selection with visual feedback for active tools
- Implement zoom functionality with percentage display
- Add document navigation controls for multi-page documents
- Create hover and active states for all buttons and interactive elements
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common operations

## 6. Integration with Document Viewers
- Modify existing `PdfViewer` component to work within the editor canvas
- Adapt the `DocxViewer` component to work within the editor interface
- Ensure both viewers maintain their functionality in the new context
- Create a seamless transition between the upload flow and editor interface

## 7. Create Tool-Specific Interfaces
- Implement mode switching based on selected tools
- Create specialized UI elements for each tool (e.g., drawing controls, text editing panel)
- Add visual feedback when different tools are selected
- Ensure all tool interfaces follow the same design language

## 8. Accessibility & Usability
- Add ARIA labels and roles to all interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the interface
- Add tooltips and helpful information for each tool
- Implement proper focus management for modal dialogs and popovers
- Ensure text has proper contrast in dark theme

## 9. Testing & Refinement
- Test the interface across different browsers and devices
- Verify that all components render correctly and maintain functionality
- Test user flows from upload to editing to saving
- Optimize performance for smooth editing experience

## 10. Documentation & Finalization
- Update the `Change.log` file with detailed changes
- Document any new APIs or components created
- Update `steps.md` to mark Step 3 as complete
- Create a plan for the next step (Implementing PDF editing features)

## Timeline & Milestones
1. Layout structure - Day 1
2. Toolbar components - Days 2-3
3. Canvas implementation - Days 3-4
4. Functionality & interactions - Days 5-6
5. Integration & tool interfaces - Days 7-8
6. Testing, accessibility & documentation - Days 9-10


# Completed Plan for Step 2: Set up basic document upload and viewing
- Complete the implementation of src/app/process/page.tsx:
  - Ensure proper file type detection logic
  - Add appropriate error handling for unsupported file types
  - Implement file size validation
- Enhance the PdfViewer component:
  - Add navigation controls for multi-page PDFs
  - Implement zoom functionality
  - Add loading indicators
- Improve the DocxViewer component:
  - Ensure proper styling preservation
  - Handle embedded images correctly
  - Add error handling for corrupted files
- Apply consistent Tailwind styling:
  - Create a consistent UI for both viewers
  - Ensure dark mode compatibility
  - Add responsive design elements
- Add basic file information display:
  - Show file name, size, and type
  - Display page count for PDFs
  - Add timestamps for upload
- Test thoroughly with various file formats and sizes
- Update documentation:
  - Update steps.md to mark step 2 as complete
