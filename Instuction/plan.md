# Next Steps

## 1. Test PDF Viewer Functionality
   - **Task:** Verify that the PDF viewer (`PdfViewer.tsx`) is working correctly after the worker configuration changes and the fix for handling empty/corrupted PDFs.
   - **Details:** 
     - Upload various PDF files (small, large, different versions) to ensure they render without errors.
     - Test with an empty PDF file or a corrupted PDF file to ensure the new warning message is displayed correctly.
     - Check console for any new warnings or errors.

## 2. Implement PDF Editing Features (using `pdf-lib`)
   - **Task:** Begin integration of `pdf-lib` for basic PDF editing capabilities.
   - **Sub-tasks:**
     - **Install `pdf-lib`:** Add `pdf-lib` as a project dependency.
     - **Create UI Components:** Design and implement UI elements for editing tools (e.g., add text, draw shapes, add/remove pages).
     - **Integrate `pdf-lib`:** Write functions to handle PDF modifications using `pdf-lib` based on user interactions.
     - **Save/Download Edited PDF:** Implement functionality to save the modified PDF or allow users to download it.

## 3. Update Project Documentation
   - **Task:** Ensure all project documentation files (`Change.log`, `steps.md`, `Project.md`) are up-to-date with the latest changes and implemented features.
   - **Details:** Document the PDF editing features, any new dependencies, and resolved issues.
