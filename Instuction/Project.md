# 📄 Web-Based Document Processing Application – Technical Documentation

> **IMPORTANT**: Do Not Touch the Tailwind configuration

## 📌 Overview

This comprehensive documentation outlines the complete architecture, technology stack, and implementation plan for creating a powerful, free-to-use browser-based document processing platform using **Next.js**. The application aims to provide a robust alternative to Adobe Acrobat with enhanced features, allowing users to:

- Edit and manipulate PDF documents
- Perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Support DOCX file formats
- Convert images to vector graphics through tracing
- Enable various file format conversions
- Process documents entirely within the browser for privacy

All processing will happen client-side, ensuring user data never leaves their device unless explicitly shared.

## 🧰 Technology Stack

### Frontend (Client-Side)

* **Framework**: Next.js 15+ (React-based framework)
  * Leverages server-side rendering for improved performance
  * Utilizes file-based routing for simplified navigation
  * Supports static site generation for faster initial loads

* **Styling**: 
  * **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
  * Alternative: Material UI for component-based design system

* **State Management**: 
  * **Redux Toolkit** - For complex global state management
  * **React Context API** - For simpler state requirements and component trees

* **Routing**: 
  * Built-in Next.js App Router (file-based routing system)
  * Supports dynamic routes and nested layouts

* **Deployment**: 
  * **Vercel** - Platform optimized for Next.js applications
  * Provides automatic CI/CD, preview deployments, and analytics

### Backend (Not Required for Core Functionality)

* The application will operate primarily client-side
* No authentication or database required for basic functionality
* All document processing happens in the browser
* Local storage will be used to save user preferences and recent documents

### AI / ML Processing (OCR, Vectorization)

* **Tesseract.js** 
  * Client-side OCR engine
  * Supports 100+ languages
  * Can run in Web Workers to prevent UI blocking

* **ImageTracer.js** 
  * Client-side image to SVG conversion
  * Converts raster images to scalable vector graphics
  * Configurable settings for different tracing styles

* **Optional Server-side Processing**:
  * Python scripts with Tesseract CLI for higher accuracy OCR
  * OpenCV for advanced image processing via API endpoints
  * Only used when client-side processing is insufficient

## 🔐 Security & Privacy Considerations

* **Input Validation and Sanitization**
  * Strict file type checking before processing
  * Content validation to prevent XSS attacks
  * Sanitization of extracted text and metadata

* **Client-side Processing**
  * Files never leave the user's device unless explicitly shared
  * No server storage of user documents
  * Processing happens entirely in the browser

* **Data Protection**
  * Temporary files stored in IndexedDB with encryption
  * Auto-clearing of cached data after session ends
  * No tracking or analytics on document content

* **API Security (if implemented)**
  * CORS restrictions to prevent unauthorized access
  * Rate limiting to prevent abuse
  * API key validation for server-side processing

* **File Restrictions**
  * Size limits to prevent DoS attacks (e.g., max 50MB per file)
  * Supported file type whitelisting
  * Malware scanning for uploaded files

  * Lazy load heavy libraries on demand:
    * Tesseract.js (5MB+ with language packs)
    * pdf-lib (only when editing is needed)
    * ImageTracer.js (when vector conversion is requested)
  * Dynamic imports in Next.js to reduce initial bundle size

* **Next.js Optimizations**
