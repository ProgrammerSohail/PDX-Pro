    - Fixed "Cannot find module 'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.entry'" error by:
      - Modifying `src/components/PdfViewer.tsx` to set `pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = new URL('pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs', import.meta.url).toString()`.
      - Updating `next.config.ts` with the recommended webpack alias for `canvas`.
    - Added handling for empty or corrupted PDF files:
      - Implemented checks in `PdfViewer.tsx` to detect empty `ArrayBuffer` or empty string content.
      - Added user-friendly warning message when an empty or corrupted PDF is detected.

## Step 3: Implement Advanced Document Editor Interface (Completed)

- Created a dedicated editor interface page (`src/app/editor/page.tsx`) that opens when a document is selected.
- Implemented a professional editor layout with the following components:
  - Top toolbar with primary actions (Upload, Edit, Convert, Save)

  - Right sidebar for editing tools (Draw, Highlight, Text, Crop)
  - Main canvas area with grid for document display and editing
  - Bottom toolbar with zoom controls and page navigation
- Developed a consistent dark-themed UI that matches the reference design.
- Created a seamless transition from document upload to editor interface.
- Implemented state management to track the active document and editing state.
- Designed a responsive layout that works across different screen sizes.
- Created reusable UI components following the folder structure guidelines:
  - Toolbar components (TopToolbar, LeftSidebar, RightSidebar)
  - Tool buttons with consistent styling and hover states
  - Canvas area with grid overlay
  - Zoom controls with percentage display
- Ensured each tool button activates the appropriate editing mode.
- Added visual feedback for active tools and editing modes.
- Implemented document display within the canvas area.
- Added navigation between document pages when applicable.
- Ensured dark mode compatibility throughout the editor interface.
- Added accessibility features for all interactive elements.
- Enhanced the interface to support all departments/file formats mentioned in the Project.md file:
  - Expanded the left sidebar to include all document types (PDF, Office, OpenOffice, Graphics, PostScript, Web, Text, Multimedia, 3D Models, Forms)
  - Added state management for tracking the active document category
  - Implemented dynamic display of the active category in the canvas area
  - Provided appropriate icons for each department/file type
- Enhanced the process page to support all file formats:
  - Created comprehensive file type definitions with MIME types and extensions
  - Implemented intelligent file type detection and categorization
  - Added a placeholder preview for file types without dedicated viewers
  - Improved the file upload area to indicate support for multiple file formats
- Updated the `Change.log` file to document the completion of this step.

## Step 4: Integrate file upload functionality with home page FileUpload component

- Move file upload functionality from the process page to the home page FileUpload component:
  - Modify `src/components/home/FileUpload.tsx` to include all upload functionality from `src/app/process/page.tsx`
  - Add drag-and-drop interface with support for all file types
  - Implement file type detection and validation
  - Add file preview section for supported document types (PDF, DOCX)
  - Create responsive UI for both the upload form and preview sections
- Implement direct editor redirection:
  - Add "Open in Editor" button in the preview section
  - Implement navigation to the editor page with appropriate file information
  - Pass document ID and type as URL parameters to the editor
- Add user experience improvements:
  - Create loading indicators for file processing
  - Implement error handling for unsupported or corrupted files

  - Create a button to upload a different file after preview
- Ensure all functionality works properly with the existing editor page:
  - Verify proper file type categorization
  - Test navigation with file information passing
  - Confirm the correct display in the editor based on file type
- Update documentation to reflect changes:
  - Document the new upload workflow
  - Update references to the process page
  - Mark items as completed in documentation files

## Step 5: Fix PDF File Upload and Display Issues

- Resolved the "The selected PDF file is empty or corrupted" error message:
  - Added local PDF.js worker file to the public directory
  - Created a proper worker loading mechanism with CDN fallback

  - Added zoom controls and pagination for better user experience
  - Made the component more resilient to different file content formats
  
- Added proper documentation and updated change logs to track the improvements

## Plan for Step 6: Implement PDF editing features (using pdf-lib)

- Create a new component for PDF editing (e.g., `src/components/PdfEditor.tsx`).
- Implement the `pdf-lib` library for PDF manipulation.
- Add functionality to edit PDF text content.
- Add functionality to add or modify annotations.
- Implement form filling capability.
- Add page manipulation tools (delete, reorder, rotate).
- Implement text and image overlay/insertion capability.
- Create a UI for editing operations.
- Add functionality to save edited PDF files.
- Update the `Change.log` file to document the completion of this step.

## Plan for Step 7: View the PDF in the editor

- **Goal:** Display the uploaded PDF content within the main canvas area of the editor interface.
- **Tasks:**
  - **Integrate `PdfViewer`:** Utilize the existing `PdfViewer` component within the editor's main canvas area.
  - **Pass PDF Data:** Ensure the selected PDF file data (URL or ArrayBuffer) is correctly passed from the `FileUpload` component (or wherever the file is managed after upload) to the `PdfViewer` instance in the editor.
  - **Canvas Sizing and Responsiveness:** Ensure the `PdfViewer` fits correctly within the allocated canvas space and is responsive to window size changes.
  - **Editor Toolbar Integration (Placeholder):** While full editing isn't the goal of this step, consider how the PDF view will interact with existing/future editor toolbars (e.g., zoom, page navigation if not part of `PdfViewer` itself).
  - **State Management:** Update application state to reflect that a PDF is being viewed in the editor.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for scenarios like:
    - PDF data not being available.
    - Issues with rendering the PDF within the viewer.
  - **Testing:**
    - Test with various PDF files (single/multi-page, different sizes).
    - Verify correct display and basic navigation (if applicable).
    - Test responsiveness.
  - **Documentation:** Update `Change.log` upon completion.
