# Project Steps for Web-Based Document Processing Application

This document outlines the planned steps to build the web-based document processing application based on the Project.md documentation.

## Overall Project Steps:

1.  Configure Dark Mode and Toggle.
2.  Set up basic document upload and viewing (PDF, DOCX).
3.  Implement Advanced Document Editor Interface.
4.  Implement PDF editing features (using pdf-lib).
5.  Implement OCR functionality (using Tesseract.js).
6.  Implement Image Tracing (using ImageTracer.js).
7.  Implement various file format conversions (Image to PDF, PDF to Image, etc.).
8.  Add security and privacy considerations (input validation, client-side processing).
9.  Implement performance optimizations (Web Workers, lazy loading).
10. Add testing and validation (Unit, Integration, E2E).
11. Refine UI/UX and add state management (Redux Toolkit/Context API).
12. Prepare for deployment (Vercel).

## Step 1: Configured Dark Mode and Toggle (Completed)

- Configured Tailwind CSS for dark mode support.
- Implemented a mechanism to toggle dark mode by adding/removing the 'dark' class on the root HTML element.
- Created a reusable component for the dark mode toggle.
- Added the toggle component to the application layout.
- Stored the user's preference for dark mode in local storage.
- Ensured the dark mode setting persists across sessions.
- Applied dark mode styles to relevant components using Tailwind CSS dark mode variants.
- Updated the `Change.log` file to document the completion of this step.

## Step 2: Set up basic document upload and viewing (Completed)

- Created a dedicated page component (`src/app/process/page.tsx`) for document uploads and viewing.
- Implemented a visually appealing drag-and-drop interface for file selection.
- Added fallback for traditional file input selection with a hidden input element.
- Implemented file type detection and validation to ensure only PDF and DOCX files are accepted.
- Added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages.
- Integrated loading states with animated spinners to improve user experience during file processing.
- Enhanced file information display to show name, type, size, and last modified date.
- Developed a `PdfViewer` component using `react-pdf` with the following features:
  - Page navigation controls for multi-page documents
  - Zoom functionality (zoom in, zoom out, reset zoom)
  - Page loading indicators
  - Text layer and annotation layer support
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Developed a `DocxViewer` component using `mammoth.js` with the following features:
  - Conversion of DOCX files to HTML for rendering
  - Custom styling to maintain document formatting
  - Style mapping to preserve document structure (headings, etc.)
  - Support for embedded images and tables
  - Error handling for corrupted or unsupported files
- Ensured dark mode compatibility for both viewer components with appropriate color schemes.
- Added accessibility improvements with proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML.
- Updated the `Change.log` file to document the completion of this step.
- **(2025-05-16)** Addressed "Cannot find module 'pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.entry'" error by:
    - Modifying `src/components/PdfViewer.tsx` to set `pdfjs.GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc = new URL('pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs', import.meta.url).toString()`.
    - Updating `next.config.ts` with the recommended webpack alias for `canvas`.

## Step 3: Implement Advanced Document Editor Interface

- Create a dedicated editor interface page (`src/app/editor/page.tsx`) that opens when a document is selected.
- Implement a professional editor layout with the following components:
  - Top toolbar with primary actions (Upload, Edit, Convert, Save)
  - Left sidebar for document-specific tools (PDF Tools, Word Tools, Image-Editing Tools)
  - Right sidebar for editing tools (Draw, Highlight, Text, Crop)
  - Main canvas area with grid for document display and editing
  - Bottom toolbar with zoom controls and page navigation
- Develop a consistent dark-themed UI that matches the reference design.
- Create a seamless transition from document upload to editor interface.
- Implement state management to track the active document and editing state.
- Design a responsive layout that works across different screen sizes.
- Create reusable UI components following the folder structure guidelines:
  - Toolbar components (TopToolbar, LeftSidebar, RightSidebar)
  - Tool buttons with consistent styling and hover states
  - Canvas area with grid overlay
  - Zoom controls with percentage display
- Ensure each tool button activates the appropriate editing mode.
- Add visual feedback for active tools and editing modes.
- Implement document display within the canvas area.
- Add navigation between document pages when applicable.
- Ensure dark mode compatibility throughout the editor interface.
- Add accessibility features for all interactive elements.
- Update the `Change.log` file to document the completion of this step.

## Plan for Step 4: Implement PDF editing features (using pdf-lib)

- Create a new component for PDF editing (e.g., `src/components/PdfEditor.tsx`).
- Implement the `pdf-lib` library for PDF manipulation.
- Add functionality to edit PDF text content.
- Add functionality to add or modify annotations.
- Implement form filling capability.
- Add page manipulation tools (delete, reorder, rotate).
- Implement text and image overlay/insertion capability.
- Create a UI for editing operations.
- Add functionality to save edited PDF files.
- Update the `Change.log` file to document the completion of this step.
